  - sentenceText: Their first experiment, which was a group of robots who knew social
      hierarchy, was a grand success! Each robot presented from a low role to a high
      role in society, and acted as programmed! Through this, the scientists (the
      human ones, of course!) will be able to aid the government as to what to do
      to help the lowly!
